# Linux-For-A-Month-Test.


>I have been hearing many good things about Linux in terms of security and usability especially with the terminal. I also have experience from my cybersecurity boot-camp on being a Linux admin so i want to practice more. Another reason i want to do this is to bring more awareness to this amazing open source OS.


### What distribution i chose.


>Because Linux is open-source this allows anyone to edit and create their own version of linux which is really cool!
>
> A list of some distrubtions include:
1. Ubuntu
2. Mint
3. Manjaro
4. Fedorah
5. Redhat

>All of these have different use cases and different desktop experinces, it can get to the point that a some linux distros (Distro -> Ditrubution) dont even have a desktop its just a command linx
